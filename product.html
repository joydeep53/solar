                    <p>
                        A solar tree is basically a construction like a
tree made up of solar panels which absorb solar
energy during the daytime and convert it into
electrical energy which can be stored in
batteries. The tree also consists of LEDs which
are activated at dusk till dawn or as long as the
batteries remain charged. These Solar Tree
Lights are also designed as Alternative option of
Office and Home Rooftop Solar Power Plant for
Energy supply, wattage upto 3Kw to 4Kw. The
internal control can also regulate the amount of
light produced depending on how much charge
is left in the batteries. Hence this saves us a lot
of energy. The concept is the same as Solar
Street Light except only one difference is there,
and that is: there is required a large number of
solar panels joint together.

                        because it can achieves very large space to height ratios. It can
                        illuminate large areas without the need for numerous lighting

                        dark weather.
